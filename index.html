        <p>Hello! My name is Jessica Bezerra and I am from Orlando, Florida. I love spending time outdoors,
            especially camping and going for walks. I’m currently studying Web Fundamentals at
            BYU–Idaho Online, working toward my associate degree in software development. I’m passionate about
            building a career in
            web development and software development. I’m excited to see where this journey will take me and
            what I’ll be able to
            create, contribute to, and be a part of along the way.</p>
