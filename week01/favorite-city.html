    <h1>My Favorite City</h1>
    <p>My favorite city is Seattle, Washingtonâ€”not just because it's home, but because of the vibrant energy that fills
        the air. From the refreshing scent of the sea breeze to the sound of ferry horns, and the bustle of Pike Place
        Market with its fresh fish, the city is alive in every way.</p>
